TODO:

- See if there's a better way of handling backend server downtimes and outages
  other than just crashing and having to restart with a offset (e.g. start from
  page 10 / document 101) which is what we do now.

- Python requests *probably* has a better way of handling timeouts and dropped
  connections but we already have it set for 5 retries before crashing out. I'm not
  sure what more we can do other than some custom code to time.slepe(5 minutes) if
  we get 10+ connection errors in a row.
  
- Note that the above will only fix the Python Requests parts of the code, if a 
  server handling a request from the Selenium-driven browser times out... then
  our entire flow is fucked and we have to start over with an offset anyway.
