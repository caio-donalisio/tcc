I recommend you run this under a Debian VM with XFCE DE. That's the default DE for Debian and it feels like navigating Windows XP. Simples. However, any Linux will probably do as long as you have a GUI / X Windows.

These instructions might not be exact. Please use basalberts.nl / google for extra help. 

root# update-get update
root# apt-get install python3 pdftotext
root# python3 pip install -U selenium
root# python3 pip install beautifulsoup4
